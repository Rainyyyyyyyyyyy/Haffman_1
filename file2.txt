A Visitor for Sherlock HolmesFor many years, I shared an apartment in London with my friend, Sherlock Holmes.  My name i s Doctor Watson. I worked as a doctor in the British Army for several years. While I was in the army, I travelled to man y strange and interesting places. I had many exciting adventures.  Then one day, in Afghanistan, I was shot in the shoul der. My wound was deep and took many months to heal. I nearly died from pain and fever. At last I got better, but I coul d not work in the army any more. I retired from the army and came back to England.  That is why I was living in London w ith Sherlock Holmes. I had known my friend for many years. Our address was 221B Baker Street, in the centre of the city.   I enjoyed sharing an apartment with Holmes. My friend was a very clever man. He was the most famous private detective in London. He helped to solve crimes and catch criminals.  When people were in trouble or needed help, they came to Holm es. Sometimes the police came to Holmes and asked for help in cas clients were rich or poor. He enjoyed solving their interesting problems. He was very happy when he was working. It was the most important thing in his life.  One afternoon, I was reading a book and Holmes was standing by the window in our sitting-room. Usually he was very busy and active. But this afternoon he did not seem very happy. I was worried about my  friend.  'What's the matter with you today, Holmes?' I asked.  'Come and stand at the window, Watson,' Holmes said. Loo k out into the street. See how uninteresting London is today.'  It was winter. The street outside was almost empty. Ever yone was at home in front of their warm fires.  'I need some work, Watson,' said Holmes impatiently. 'I cannot live with out interesting problems and mysteries. That's why I became a private detective. I love my work. It keeps my brain activ e. But when there are no crimes and no mysteries to solve - ah, then life becomes very boring for me.'  He turned sadly a criminal.  Sherlock Holmes did not care if his clients were rich or poor.
